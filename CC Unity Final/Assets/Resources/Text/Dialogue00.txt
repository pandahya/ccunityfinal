Damn. Guess I need to take the medicine.
Okay. Maybe not the time.
I think I may treat myself a cup of coffee first.
The room is in a mess. I really need to clean up these dirty clothes.
I won't mind washing those clothes while waiting for my coffee.
Okay. That's much better.
Oh. My flower. When was the last time I watered it?
Now let me just enjoy the coffee.
?
Oh, the medicine. I almost forget.
Wh, what? Who knocks at this late hour?
Fine. It's none of my business.
What? Why is the tap broken?
Okay. Anyway, I'll go to the bathroom.
